> Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes. 

```{r}
Expression <- read.table("expression.txt")
```
```{r}
head(Expression)
```

```{r}
nrow(Expression)
```

```{r}
table(Expression$geno)
```

```{r}
summary(Expression$exp)
```
To creat box plot lets use ggplot

> Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(Expression) + 
  aes(x = geno, y = exp, col = geno) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

looking at the graph it looks like blue has a lot lower expression than red and green, and so it does seems like the SNP affect the epxression of ORMDL3.
